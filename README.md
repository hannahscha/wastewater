# wastewater
In wastewater treatment, oxygen is supplied to support biological processes in an aeration tank. The oxygen transfer rate (OTR) is crucial for maintaining sufficient dissolved oxygen (DO) levels to meet biological oxygen demand (BOD). 
Develop a python-based iterative app for a common problem in wastewater treatment: calculating the oxygen transfer rate (OTR) in an aeration tank. This process involves iteratively calculating the dissolved oxygen (DO) levels based on oxygen transfer and consumption rates.
This app will:
•	Simulate the dissolved oxygen (DO) profile over time in the aeration tank.
•	Iteratively calculate DO levels using the oxygen transfer and consumption rates.
•	Allow users to adjust parameters such as oxygen transfer efficiency (OTE), oxygen consumption rate, and initial DO.
•	Plot the DO concentration over time.
